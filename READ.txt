Right now, the code is set for a demo main_data_generation, you need all the folders to run the entire program properly. 

YOU HAVE TO CREATE INSIDE THE FOLDER WITH ALL THE CODES A FILE NAMED 'Images' AND A FOLDER NAMED 'dat files'.

It is also set in main_data_analysis, you also need all the folders + the Base_01fits.dat file inside the 'dat files'


import imageio.v2 as imageio
import csv
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import skimage
import sklearn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from quantimpy import minkowski as mk
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
import statmorph
import astropy
from PIL import Image

You have to be able to load all of those to run the entire program too.
